            <h2>Library Management System</h2>
            <h3>this is the mini project where i have used core python programming language.</h3>
            <p>A library management system keeps track of the books present in the library. It is an important piece of software which is a must at schools and colleges. We will build a library management system using Tkinter to make it interactive.</p>

            <h2>Traffic light controller</h2>
            <h3>We have used the verilog programming language for creating this mini project. </h3>
            <p>A Verilog source code for a traffic light controller on FPGA is presented. A sensor on the farm is to detect if there are any vehicles and change the traffic light to allow the vehicles to cross the highway. Otherwise, highway light is always green since it has higher priority than the farm. </p>

            <h2>Smart Heath Monitoring System</h2>
            <h3>Here we have used IoT for this major project.</h3>
            <p>Healthcare monitoring system in hospitals and many other health centers has experienced significant growth, and portable healthcare monitoring systems with emerging technologies are becoming of great concern to many countries worldwide nowadays. The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies facilitates the progress of healthcare from face-to-face consulting to telemedicine. </p>
